## Introduction
Process is one of the important parts of the project. Compliance with the process is the responsibility of each programmer. We always promote discipline and seriousness of each individual.
Below is a guide for you on some common processes and standards for the entire project including:
1. [Preparation steps before developing this project](#1-preparation-steps-before-developing-this-project)
2. [Branching and commit organization standards](#2-branching-and-commit-organization-standards)
3. [General working process for programmer position](#3-general-working-process-for-programmer-position)

## Guideline

### 1. Preparation steps before developing this project
You need to pull the source code from the repo. Before starting to code, you need to set up some folders and files to help unify the team's coding standards

Step1: prettier config
<details>
<summary>For Vscode</summary>
If you used vscode, you must config this line bellow in .vscode/setting.json.
If you don't already have it, please create it.

```javascript
{
    ...,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
}
```
</details>

Step2: Husky config
```javascript
npm run prepare
```

Step3: Enjoy your code
```javascript
# for dev
yarn start
# for build
yarn build
# for preview my build
yarn preview
```

### 2. Branching and commit organization standards
```
# For common brach, their name must be follow this convention:
    <type>/<business-group>-<ticket-number>_<purpose>
    - type, business-group and purpose required
    - ticket-number is optional
```
Ex: feature/claims-45_add-policy-comparison.

<details>
<summary>type</summary>

### Detail for type list
* hotfix: for quickly fixing critical issues, usually with a temporary solution
* fixbug: for fixing a bug
* feature: for adding, removing or modifying a feature
* test: for experimenting something which is not an issue
* wip: 	for a work in progress
</details>

<details>
<summary>business-group</summary>
what is business logic for your code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>purpose</summary>
what is your purpose of your code.
</details>

<details>
<summary>ticket-number</summary>
ticket's id you processing for this code.
</details>

#### a. Code convention rules
All pull request must be check with list condition.

| Item                                                                                | Pass: P /Fail: N /NA |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| NO code duplication                                                                 |                      |
| NO spelling and grammar mistakes                                                    |                      |
| NO console.X(), unused code, import statements                                      |                      |
| USE lower, kebab case for route/page url                                            |                      |
| USE 'const' to declare variable unless it mutable                                   |                      |
| USE dot notation instead of square bracket, except dynamic object                   |                      |
| USE native api instead of 3rd library, e.g Array.forEach instead lodash \_.forEach  |                      |
| DECLARE const variable for repeated value                                           |                      |
| DECLARE variable or helper function for complicated expression(if else condition)   |                      |
| KEEP naming of variables/functions short, clean, selft descriptive                  |                      |
| AVOID use ANY, always define interface for data, e.g component props, api response  |                      |
| AVOID big code block, consider to BREAK into small functions(around 30 lines is ok) |                      |
| MINIMIZE logic in the render function, move to helpers or components                |                      |
| SPLIT component as small as possible, follow single responsibility principle        |                      |
| LANGUAGE key must be added to all translation files                                 |                      |
| CHECK current translation for new language key and use if exist                     |                      |

#### c. Git Graph
Every branch which used for fix bug, create new features,... alway checkout and create a pull request when done. Follow this diagram bellow

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%
      gitGraph
        commit tag:"v1.0.15"
        branch hotfix
        checkout hotfix
        commit
        branch develop
        checkout develop
        commit id:"111"
        branch featureB
        checkout featureB
        commit type:HIGHLIGHT
        checkout master
        checkout hotfix
        commit type:NORMAL
        checkout develop
        commit type:REVERSE
        checkout featureB
        commit
        checkout master
        merge hotfix
        checkout featureB
        commit
        checkout develop
        branch featureA
        commit
        checkout develop
        merge hotfix
        checkout featureA
        commit
        checkout featureB
        commit
        checkout develop
        merge featureA
        branch release
        checkout release
        commit
        checkout master
        commit tag:"v1.1.0"
        checkout release
        merge master
        checkout develop
        merge release
```
### 3. General working process for programmer position

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A[Product Backlog] -->|Prioritize| B(Sprint Planning Meeting);
  B -->|Select| C[Sprint Backlog];
  C -->|Assign| D(Tasks);
  D --> E(Development);
  E --> F{Done?};
  F -->|Yes| G(Review Meeting);
